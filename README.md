# Diabetes-Prediction-challenge
This universitary project is related to Machine Learning course. The aim is to find the best model in order to predict Diabetes. I use the Knime Software in order to develop 
Data Exploration, Data Transformation, Model Evaluation and an explanatory dashboard.
In this repo you can find the work paper and two knime workflow. The Training workflow contains the model training and evaluation, with a complete data explanatory 
dashboard. The second one allows you to test my model with a valid test set.
